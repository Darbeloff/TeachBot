Thank you for taking part in our user study! My name is TeachBot, and I am a Sawyer robot arm. You can program me to do whatever you want.
Add steps to the program by pressing buttons on the box in front of you. The blue button opens or closes my gripper.
Usually, my arm is fixed, and you can't move it, but, if you press the black button, my arm will go limp, and you can move it wherever you want, like this.
The yellow button allows me to memorize a point to go to. So, if you want me to move from where I am now over to the right, you would press the black button, move my arm over,
and press the black button again to fix my arm. Then, you could press the yellow button to tell me to remember that point.
Finally, when you are done programming, press the red button to see your program in action.
Now you try!
