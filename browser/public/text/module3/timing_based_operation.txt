The first one we'll talk about is purely about timing. Since I know that the conveyor belt is doing a repetitive cycle thats constantly timed, I can just use that to figure out when to grab the box, and even when to place it back. That would look something like this.
This kind of methodology is known as timing based coordination.
Timing based coordination is great for things like this where I know exactly the amount of time that motions will take place. But what happens if the timing gets messed up, even by a small amount?
Something like this would happen.
Can you fix this by programming a different amount of time I should wait before attemping to grab the box? You can change the wait time using the scroll wheel. 
Seems like this one isn't working that well. Can you try again?
Hmmmm. It seems like there just isn't a perfect timing for all of the boxes being dispensed. The timing is very inconsistent.
This problem kind of reminds me of when I tried to move my arm to a target in Module 1 and missed the target. Because I didn't listen very closely to feedback I was receiving, I would miss the target because I was, to some extent, guessing my position.
