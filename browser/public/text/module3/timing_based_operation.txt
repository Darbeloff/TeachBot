Let’s say the conveyor belt delivers one box to me every five seconds, stops for two seconds for me to pick up the box, and then continues. No matter what I do, the conveyor belt will do this.
The first one we’ll talk about is purely about timing. Since I know that the conveyor belt is doing a repetitive cycle that’s constantly timed, I can just use that to figure out when to grab the box, and even when to place it back if necessary. That would look something like this.
This methodology is called timing based coordination.
Timing based coordination is great for things like this where I know exactly the amount of time that motions will take place. But what happens if the timing gets messed up, even by a small amount?
Something like this would happen.
Can you fix this by changing the amount of time I should wait before attempting to grab the box? Currently, it is set to wait for 5 seconds. Turn the scroll wheel to change the amount and press it when you are done.
Thanks, now let me try.
It seems like this one isn’t working well. Can you tell me a different time?
Hmmm. There seems to be no perfect timing for all of the boxes being dispensed.
