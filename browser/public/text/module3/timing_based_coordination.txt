Let's say the conveyor belt delivers one box to me every five seconds, stops for two seconds for me to pick up the box, and then continues. No matter what I do, the conveyor belt will do this.
The first one we'll talk about is purely about timing. Since I know that the conveyor belt is doing a repetitive cycle that's constantly timed, I can just use that to figure out when to grab the box. That would look something like this.
This methodology is called timing based coordination.
Timing based coordination is great for things like this where I know exactly the amount of time that motions will take place. But what happens if the conveyor belt moves at a different speed?
Something like this would happen.
Or, if the boxes are delivered at a random pace, I will miss some or all boxes like how I did earlier.
Timing based coordination requires precise timing on the conveyor belt. Any small errors can accumulate over time and eventually lead to failure of tasks.
