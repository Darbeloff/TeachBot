Before jumping into new contents, let me briefly walk you through things you learned in previous modules to help you learn new concepts.
Do you still remember what sequence is and why it is important? If I want to pick up this box and put it into the bin, I can't just do it in one step.
First, I need to move my gripper right above the box.
Then, I grab and pick up the box,
And finally put it into the bin like this.
As you saw, I moved to a sequence of positions in order to put the box into the bin.
Today, we are going to learn a similar concept. Instead of just picking up boxes, I'm going to interact with external devices that are almost always present on a factory floor.
